# Terraform Lab Repository

This repository contains the work developed for my Terraform Lab as part my education in IaC.  
It includes all configurations, exercises, and practical implementations related to Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform.  
The main focus of this lab is the deployment of a highly available web service, applying cloud architecture principles and best practices in Terraform.
